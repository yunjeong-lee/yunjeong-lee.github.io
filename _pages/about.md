I am a PhD student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Ilya Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/). I am interested in programming languages, specifically with regard to their design. My current projects are about developing (1) a repair tool for ambiguous context-free grammars based on automata theory and (2) a meta-DSL for developing DSLs that enable the language design objectives. My favorite languages are Racket and OCaml.

Prior to PhD, I was a Research Intern at NUS School of Computing. I have a MSc in Energy Systems from Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, and BS in Finance and Mathematics from New York University.

I go by my first name, Yunjeong (pronounced as /yeon jeong/, 연정 in Korean).
